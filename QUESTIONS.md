* I assumed that the formula should be 
```
(dog_size * food_req) * 1.2 - remaining_food
```
but the example shows the correct formula is
```
((dog_size * food_req) - remaining_food) * 1.2 
```

* Should the answer be rounded to the nearest whole integer?

* Should the lowest possible minimum order be 0?

* Should the script require user inputs or argument parser?
